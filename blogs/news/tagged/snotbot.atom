<p>Spirit Bear Coffee Company believes that humans are stewards for the planet and without healthy oceans, we won’t have a viable home. “Ocean Alliance’s mission is to protect whales and their ocean environment through research, scientific collaboration, public education, and the arts.” In order to accomplish this, they study the largest mammals on the planet: whales. We are so excited to announce the partnership between <strong><a href="https://whale.org/" target="_blank" title="ocean alliance web link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ocean Alliance</a></strong> and Spirit Bear Coffee Company. Starting November 1st, when you buy our <strong><a href="https://spiritbearcoffeecompany.com/collections/coffee/products/orca-dark-roast" target="_blank" title="orca dark roast coffee product link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orca Dark Roast</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://spiritbearcoffeecompany.com/collections/coffee/products/dolphin-decaffeinated" target="_blank" title="spirit bear coffee company dolphin swiss water decaf coffee link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dolphin Swiss Water Processed Decaf</a></strong>, a portion of the profits will be going directly to Ocean Alliance.</p>

<p>In prior years, studying whales involved taking skin/blubber biopsies to determine pollutant levels in whales and our ocean food chains as well as assessing the overall health of the whale. As technology progressed, <strong>Ocean Alliance</strong> developed a new non-invasive method of sample collection. The lead initiative in their <strong>Drones For Whale Research</strong> program is <strong>SnotBot</strong>®, a drone that collects a priceless biological data set from the whales exhalation. <strong>SnotBot</strong>® is a drone that has been outfitted with petri dishes. As the whale exhales, biological material is sprayed up into the air where the <strong>SnotBot</strong>® waits. Through analysis of the whales blow (or Snot), we can examine DNA, hormones, and microbiomes which helps us assess the health of the whale which mirrors the health of our oceans.</p>
